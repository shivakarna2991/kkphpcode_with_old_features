This directory has changes/extensions for the PHPExcel library.  It is not the full library, just the changes/extensions.

The full library is in idax/vendor/PHPExcel.

The way this works is that the app will include the modified PHPExcel.php from here instead of the original one in the full library.  The modified one uses a modified autoloader which will check for class files first in changes/extensions directory, and, if not found, then check in the full library.
